Just another repository
Hello fellow GitHub members, my name is Tyler. I am new to the coding and programming field of things. I am looking forward to learning and achieving my goals of becoming a professional programer in the career world. I am a college student who is stepping into the programming field fresh. You can consider me a "freshman" in this field. I am excited to better learn the tools that GitHub and other coding programs have to offer me. I cannot wait to start one of my own projects within the GitHub Community ladies and gentalmen!
